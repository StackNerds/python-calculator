# Python Calculator

Here we implement different simple versions of a python calculator, each version of the calculator adds a new improvement.

### Version 1.0 : Extremely basic

Simply gets two inputs (integers only), calls a function that does the operation on the two inputs using in-built operators to return the result.

### Version 1.1 : Extremely basic, demonstrates multiplication and division without * and /

Same functions as in 1.0, but does not use `*` for multiplication and `/` for division, unlike in 1.0, carrying out a division that has decimal numbers won't work here or return 0.
